# Machine_Learning
Machine Learning project

Goal of this project is to train a machine learning model on current/time curves measured from different devices.

#### ML input parameters:
(Starting parameters)
- Voltage
- Current
- Frequency
- pulse lenght
- (device age)
...
#### Model output:
The module should produce a function _f(t)_ that describes the path followed by the current for given starting parameters.


## Roadmap

- decide on a time function model
- decide if current saturation over time should be considered
- choose a machine learning method
